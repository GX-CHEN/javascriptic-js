Existing features of the website UI:
1. JS code snippets (powered by repl.it) which allows learners to run the code, or edit the code then run to see the result in the console
2. Navigation through the sidebar (supported nested folder structure)
3. Responsive web support, which allows this website used in tablet, or even smart phones (though not recommended)

Proposed features (ordered from higher to lower priorities)
1. Add some more explanation in plain text (a new html section alongside with the repl.it code snippet)
2. Chinese language support which allow users to switch the language with a button click. This depends on the proposed feature #1
3. Show learner's study history (when using the same browser) to allow:
   1. Allow user to mark a tutorial as finished
   2. Show a green check for the finished items in the sidebar
   3. Display "finished indicator" in the tutorial page (if completed)
   4. Allow user to mark a finished tutorial back to "unfinished status"
4. Add user login support, so users can optionally login, to access the course history across browsers/devices.
